# Homework W03-D01

## Fridge

Finish the [Fridge Lab](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi_dc5/blob/master/w03/d01/fridge_manager/README.md) given in-class.

## Validations

Tomorrow we're going to be talking about Validations in ActiveRecord, so read
the [Rails Guide on AR Validations](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html),
specifically sections 1, 2, and 7.

Add at least one validation to your Fridge app, and play with it in pry to see how it works. Refer back to the guide linked above to make sure you understand what's going on.
