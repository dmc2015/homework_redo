# Lab & Weekend Homework (w04d05)

## Learning Objectives
* Get familiar with the basics of web apps (HTTP req/resp, routes, params)
* Practice building an app in Sinatra
* Practice building forms that submit data to params in Sinatra
* Re-use existing code in a new interface context (i.e. port an app from terminal to web)
* Practice reading unfamiliar documentation and applying it.

## Build a 2+ model Sinatra app

For lab today, you should pick any of the appropriate exercises or projects
we've done, and 'port' them to Sinatra. Examples include:

* Fridge / Food
* Personal Finanace
* Flash Cards
* Battleship
* Gladiator
* Pokemon / Trainers

You don't have to pick the project the project that you worked on last week, but
you can if you want.

In fact, your app can be any 2+ model app, as long as it supports meaningful
CRUD actions (or in the case of a game like Battleship equivalent or greater
complexity). If you want to build something that's not on the list, just check
with us first!

## Catch up on old homework

If you have any old HW assignments that you'd like to submit, now's your chance.

## Read up on rails

Next week we're going to be learning rails all week (and our project the following week).

Please prepare by reading the Rails Guide: Getting Started with Rails, and
trying to follow with the code-along they do. You only need to read ยง1 - 6 (up
to and through 'Adding a Second Model').
