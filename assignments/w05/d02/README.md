# Dat Blog Doe - w05 d02

## Outline

AMAco feels bad for making you build so many apps just so we could explore new markets. AMAco PDA, AMAco WMATA, deck o' cards, high card, Pok√©Arena, AMAco Realty (pts 1 & 2), Gladiator Arena, Fridge Manager, Todo Manager, Battleship, Personal Finance, Flash Cards, Tun.r 1.0, Tun.r 2.0, Tun.r Rails, tWDIr... the list goes on and on...

So tonight, we want to thank you by letting you get creative and build a blog app. We have some basic requirements, but other than that, you should feel free to express yourself through your blog's code and design.

We'll be coming back to this blog app, so make sure you focus on writing clean code that you can maintain! And make it your own!

In fact, you may want to host this blog platform your build on the web, and use it to publish your thoughts on things your learn during and/or after the course. This is a great way to share your thinking on code with other developers (and maybe even impress potential employers).


### A note on walkthroughs / guides

Please don't follow any guides or tutorials on how to build a blog. (i.e. the "Intro to Rails Guide" you read over the weekend.)

You **are** welcome to look at other apps we've built, your notes, StackOverflow (and similar sites for specific questions), but no walkthroughs.

The focus here is to practice and increase our understanding of how a Rails app is built.

## Requirements

Here are the requirements:

The app:
* has to be written in rails
* has to have at least 2 models
* one of those models must be something like a post
  * the post must have a title and body
* the other model is up to you (could be comments, categories, tags, etc)
* you should be able to create, edit, and delete posts
